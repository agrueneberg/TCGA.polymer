        <p>
            This playground demonstrates the use of <a
            href="http://www.polymer-project.org">Polymer</a> to create a few
            <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov">TCGA</a>-related Web
            Components: a cancer type selector, a patient selector and an RPPA
            browser. All components are working together: selecting a patient
            in the patient selector will filter for antibody expressions in
            the RPPA browser, and selecting a cancer type will change the two
            other elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use the Web Components on their own or in different
            contexts (without the worry of overwriting global variables and
            such) by loading the Polymer polyfill, importing the custom
            elements, and adding an HTML tag such as
            <code>&lt;tcga-dashboard /&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Not all patients appear in the RPPA data, i.e. some
            selections won't do anything. Also, some cancer types do not have
            associated patient data. Try <code>TCGA-02-0003</code>,
            <code>TCGA-02-0011</code>, or <code>TCGA-02-0014</code> for
            <code>GBM</code> to get an idea of what this tool is doing.
